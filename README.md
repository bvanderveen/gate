# OWIN â€” Open Web Interface for .NET, v1.0 Draft 

## Overview

OWIN defines a standard interface between .NET web servers and web applications. The goal of the OWIN interface is to decouple server and application, encourage the development of simple modules for .NET web development, and, by being an open standard, stimulate the open source ecosystem of .NET web development tools. 

Owin defines a single anonymous delegate signature, and therefore introduces no dependencies. Read [OWIN 1.0 Draft](http://owin.github.com/owin) specification.
